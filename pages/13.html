<h3>Excercise: Standard Deviation</h3>
<p>With what we have learnt so far, we should have enough to implement a function that calculates the standard deviation of a list of numbers. You can use <a href="http://clojuredocs.org/quickref/Clojure%20Core">this reference sheet</a> to explore the clojure functions you might need. The standard deviation is defined as:</p>

<blockquote>Root of the Average of the square differences from the mean</blockquote>

<p> Your standard deviation function should take a collection of numbers and return the standard deviation.</p>
