<p>But fate intervenes. Nazi germany invades Poland, and war breaks out in Europe.</p>

<p>Turing returns to England to work on code breaking. From his efforts and the work of Von Neumann, the modern computer is born in a bid to break German codes. The ideas of Turing, and the manner in which computation is carried out, is now the default manner in which computers are reasoned about and programmed.</p>

<p>Almost twenty years pass before lambda calculus returns to our story. In 1958, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McCarthy_(computer_scientist)">John McCarthy</a> writes a theoretical paper on the computation of recursive function. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Russell">Steve Russell</a> reads the paper and realises that the 'eval' function can be implemented in machine code. This is the first Lisp interpreter. </p>

<p>There are now two high level languages available to programmers: Fortran which embodies the ideas of Turing, and Lisp, which embodies those of Church.</p>

<p>Today, we can still observe the legacy of these two models of computation in the languages we use. For example, a direct thread connects the ideas of Turing to C, and then onto OOP as examplified in C# and Java. </p>

<p>Similarly, the ideas of lambda calculus are evident in Lisp and functional languages. If you want to better understand this, there is a <a href="http://codon.com/programming-with-nothing">great talk</a> by Tom Stuart that uses Ruby to explore lambda calculus.</p>

<p>In essence, Lisp stems from a different place than most other programming languages, and is based on a radically different model of computation. It is interesting to note that as machines have grown more powerful and languages have evolved, they have moved slowly closer to Lisp and further away from the Turing paradigm. This is a long running trend, starting with conditionals (yes, that's right) being introduced into Algol by McCarthy from Lisp. Other features that have slowly migrated into mainstream languages and we now take for granted but had their beginnings in Lisp are first order functions, recursion and garbage collection!</p>
