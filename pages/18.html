<h3>Lisp has macros</h3>
<!--
technically, this isn't neccessary, but it would be very strange for this not be in a lisp...
-->
<p>It's a bit strange to introduce the topic so early, but this is just about planting the seed that will grow into something else.</p> 

<p>Macros are read-time code transformations.</p>

<p>Macros take in a list representing the code and return a list representing the transformed code.</p>

<p>What macros are actually useful for is to add new constructs to the language.</p>

<p>Unlike in other languages, if a feature is missing, you have the power to add it.</p> 

<p>Let's imagine we want to write an 'unless' (this is a typical macro example)</p>

<p>We could try writing </p>

<div class="code">
; this will fail
(defn unless [condition form]
  (if expr nil form))
</div>

<p>Why don't you try it to see the problem</p>

<div class="code">
(unless false (prn "should print"))
(unless true (prn "should not print"))
</div>

<p>Why is this going wrong? </p>
