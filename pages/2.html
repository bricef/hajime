<h2>Workshop?</h2>

<p>This workshop is divided into two major sections. In the first half we'll talk about some of the key features of Lisp, and show how they're implemented in Clojure and what it means for the language. In the second, we'll talk about some key features of Clojure, and how they can make your life easier when dealing with real world problems.</p>

<p>The entire thing <em>should</em> take us about two hours. I have no idea what will actually happen when we run through it :)</p>
