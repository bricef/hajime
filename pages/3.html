<h3>What's missing?</h3>

<p>There are several features that would be nice to have but that haven't made it yet:</p>

<ul>
<li>Showing the title of the next and previous step.</li>
<li>Being able to drill down into the errors from both the REPL and the loaded file</li>
<li>Highlighting the line that caused an error.</li>
<li>Being able to change the theme of the editor.</li>
<li>Being able to save your session for a later date.</li>
<li>Being able to jump directly to a step in the tutorial.</li>
<li>Having multiple files opened at once (perhaps in tabs?)</li>
<li>Seeing the current namespace in the REPL.</li>
</ul>
