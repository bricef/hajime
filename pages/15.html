<h3>Excercise: FizzBuzz</h3>

<p>Implement the FizzBuzz function in Clojure.</p>

<p>Your fizzbuzz implementation should accept a range of numbers and print out 'Buzz' for multiples of three, 'Fizz' for multiples of 5 and 'FizzBuzz' for multiples of both. Other numbers should be printed out as they are.</p>
