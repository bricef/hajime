<h3>Lazy Collections</h3>
<p>Clojure also uses lazy collections. This means that the values in the colection are only evaluated when needed. For example, try running <code>(repeat 3)</code> in the repl. What happens?</p>

<p>Now try running <code>(take 5 (repeat 3))</code>. </p>

<p>There are other functions that work with lazy collections:</p>

<ul>
  <li>interleave</li>
  <li>repeat</li>
  <li>cycle</li>
</ul>

<p>You can have a look at the <a href="http://clojure.org/data_structures">collection API</a> for more.</p>

<!--example: data filtering with additional complication introduce the ->> and -> oper in clojure-->
