<h3>The editor and REPL</h3>

<p>On the right are the editor pane at the top and the REPL at the bottom. The REPL environment is automatically updated with the editor code.</p>

<p>For example, try running <code>(hello "bob")</code> in the REPL.</p>

<p>The REPL is a fully featured Clojure REPL, with all features enabled. Try defining a goodbye function via the REPL.</p>

<p>To help learners it is also possible to add demo code into the editor directly from the tutorial. For example, try clicking on the <em>add to session</em> link beneath the following code.</p>


<div class="code">(defn square [x] 
  (* x x))</div>

<p>You should now be immediately able to use <code>square</code> in the REPL.</p>
