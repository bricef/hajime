<h2>Clojure?</h2>

<p><a href="http://clojure.org">Clojure</a> is a 6 year old Lisp for the JVM, it's powerful, expressive and opinionated. It is the brainchild of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_Hickey">Rich Hickey</a> with contributions from many others. While the core language is stable and small, the tooling and ecosystem are still rapidly evolving. </p>

<p>So why am I giving this workshop? Because clojure is <em>fun!</em> </p>

<p>I'm still very much a novice programmer in general, an even more so with Clojure, but I've never enjoyed programming more with another language. So I wanted to share. Most of the interesting examples and explanations in this workshop are mostly me <s>shamelessly stealing from</s> being inspired by cleverer and more experienced people. </p>

<p>I will note here that clojure tooling is not particularly newbie friendly compared to other languages. This observation is in general true of Clojure. A lot of the design choices where made to make the life of an experienced developer easy, rather than a new programmer. In my opinion, Clojure is not a good first language, perhaps even not a good second language. I've tried to reduce friction as much as possible by building this environment, but some of the complexity may leak through. It's worthwhile to note that the difficulties with starting are more than repaid when you start throwing real problems at the language.</p>
