<h3>Datastructures</h3>
<p>We also have rich data structures, like maps. Maps are quite interesting, since they can be used like functions for lookup. For example this is how we define a map:</p>

<pre class="code">{"first-key" "first-value" 
"second-key" "second-value"}</pre>

<p>Maps are a little more powerful than in other languages</p>

<pre class="code">({:a 1 :b 2} :a)</pre>

<p> We're also introducing keywords above. 
 Keywords follow the same syntax rules 
 as symbols, but start with a colon. 
 They're more efficient than either symbols
 or string when used for comparison and lookup</p>

<div class="code">; keywords can also be used for lookup.
(:a {:a 1 :b 2})

; but there's a more traditional syntax too
(get {:a 1 :b 2} :a)</div>

<p>Data structures are actually much Richer! Have a look at <a href="http://clojure.org/data_structures">the documentation</a>, which goes through this in much more details.</p>
