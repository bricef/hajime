<h1>0. An introduction to Clojure</h1>

<p>
Welcome to the Clojure workshop of Cambridge Software Craftsmanship's Seven Language in Seven Workshops Series.
</p>

<h2>What this workshop is about</h2>

<p>The aim of this workshop is to introduce you to Clojure. I hope that you'll walk away understanding a little bit more about what Clojure is, and having learnt some of the key concept of the language. I also hope that you'll know where to find more information and how Clojure could fit in your toolbox.</p>

<p>The aim is <em>not</em> to teach you clojure. </p>
<p>The aim is <em>not</em> to help you set up a clojure environment. </p>
<p>The aim is <em>not</em> to introduce the tooling or the ecosystem around Clojure. </p>

<p>These are all worthy and interesting things, but we'll not be discussing them at all in this session. There are lots of great resource to do this online and in print. At the end of this workshop, we'll provide you with a series of links to further resources that will cover these topics.</p>
